        <p class="lead">I own very few domain names now, but that has not always been the case. When I first discovered hosting on the Internet I owned many domain names, short ones, long complex ones with dashes which were not condusive to phone exchanges, and some wishful project ones. After a while this got out of hand, silly, and expensive. </p>
        <p class="lead">Having let all my domains lapse some years back, in May 2011, I decided I needed a domain name of my own to use. I decided on ciscodude.net, and registered it with Joker immediately. 7 months later, I wanted a valid SSL cert, so I purchased one from WHMCS for <a href="https://secure.ciscodude.net">cn=secure.ciscodude.net</a>. Several minutes later I had a valid cert. After reverse proxying many services through this certificate, configuration got too complex, and I set out to procure a wildcard cert. </p>
        <p class="lead">I found a reseller who charged $94 US after tax for a Comodo PositiveSSL Wildcard, and generated a certificate request for cn=*.ciscodude.net. I was not immediately provided with a valid, signed wildcard cert. I started to get concerned and read the fine print, it seems that as my domain contained the word Cisco that they may have flagged it for additional "Brand Validation". 
        <p class="lead">It seems at the sub-$100 level that validation is not done on the cert, but more to prevent certs which may be used to scam on other valid brands. I made it plenty clear that I this was to be used mostly on my network to prevent annoying SSL warnings, and not for commercial purposes, but Comodo denied the cert. I was refunded a credit, and I thought about my options. In a flash I registered henchman21.net and generated a new cert signing request for cn=*.henchman21.net and submitted it with my credit as payment. I was almost immediately presented with a valid, signed, wildcard cert. </p>
